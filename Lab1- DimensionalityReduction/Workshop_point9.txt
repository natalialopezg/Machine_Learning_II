What are the underlying mathematical principles behind UMAP? 
==============================================================================

ÂŒe theoretical foundations for UMAP are largely based in manifold theory
and topological data analysis. Much of the theory is most easily explained
in the language of topology and category theory.

At a high level, UMAP uses local manifold approximations and patches
together their local fuzzy simplicial set representations to construct a 
topological representation of the high dimensional data. Given some low 
dimensional representation of the data, a similar process can be used to 
construct an equivalent topological representation. UMAP then optimizes 
the layout of the data representation in the low dimensional space, to 
minimize the cross-entropy between the two topological representations.

The construction of fuzzy topological representations can be broken
down into two problems: approximating a manifold on which the data is
assumed to lie; and constructing a fuzzy simplicial set representation of
the approximated manifold.

MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES:
- Manifold assumption
- Fuzzy simplicial set
- Riemannian geometry
- Stochastic optimization

What is it useful for?
==============================================================================
UMAP is useful for generating visualisations, but if you want to make 
use of UMAP more generally for machine learning tasks it is important 
to be be able to train a model and then later pass new data to the 
model and have it transform that data into the learned space.

While UMAP can be used for standard unsupervised dimension reduction 
the algorithm offers significant flexibility allowing it to be extended 
to perform other tasks, including making use of categorical label 
information to do supervised dimension reduction, and even metric learning.

UMAP can be used as an effective preprocessing step to boost the 
performance of density based clustering.
