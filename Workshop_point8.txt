What strategies do you know (or can think of) in order to make PCA more robust?
==============================================================================
rincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is the problem of finding a lowrank 
approximation to a matrix. It is a central problem in statistics, but it is
sensitive to sparse errors with large magnitudes. Robust PCA addresses this problem
by decomposing a matrix into the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix,
thereby separating out the sparse errors 

Traditional PCA can handle small noise, but is brittle with respect to grossly 
corrupted observations-- even one grossly corrupt observation can significantly 
mess up answer.

Robust PCA factors a matrix into the sum of two matrices, M=L+S, 
where M is the original matrix, L is low-rank, and S is sparse. 
This is what we'll be using for the background removal problem! 
Low-rank means that the matrix has a lot of redundant information-- 
in this case, it's the background, which is the same in every 
scene (talk about redundant info!). Sparse means that the matrix 
has mostly zero entries-- in this case, see how the picture of 
the foreground (the people) is mostly empty. (In the case 
of corrupted data, S is capturing the corrupted entries).
